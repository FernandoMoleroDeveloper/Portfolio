  "text:who": "As a web developer, I combine my passion for coding & design to create online solutions that are efficient and attractive. I have over 17 years of experience in the fields of photography and graphic design, including 14 years as the owner of my own company, Strawberryphoto. I decided to focus entirely web development in 2022, and since then I have been learning and applying new technologies and techniques, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I believe that my background in design & image gives me a unique creative perspective in web development. Always looking for ways to improve my skills and produce high-quality work, I am seeking an opportunity to develop my skills further and apply them in meaningful projects. I am willing to work hard and learn everything that is necessary to achieve my goals and contribute to the success of the companies.I am also an certified drone pilot in my spare time & for photography projects."
